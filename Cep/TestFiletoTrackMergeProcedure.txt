This file is created in a TestBranch of the Cepbasic repository.

The edits in this file were done from inside this branch and I will try and merge them into the ExpiredReign branch to track the steps.
This is done to try and eliminate the errors I introduce whenever I try to merge the Master into ExpiredReign. I do this when Thal has done some work and I am behind, yet the 'Sync' option in the ExpiredReign branch is unavailable.
